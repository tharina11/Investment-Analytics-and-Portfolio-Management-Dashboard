# Investment Analytics & Portfolio Management Dashboard

## About the Project

This project is a self-directed investment analytics system designed to support data-driven personal investing using business and financial analysis principles. The goal is to replicate institutional-style portfolio monitoring by combining automated data ingestion, fundamental analysis, and interactive visualization.

The system imports live market data and company fundamentals for both stocks and ETFs, including prices, valuation metrics (P/E), earnings and cash flow growth, market capitalization, beta, and expense ratios. Portfolio holdings are maintained externally in Excel to ensure separation of data and logic, enabling scalable and maintainable updates without code changes.

Using Python, the project automates data collection, metric calculation (market value, allocation percentages, EPS and FCF growth), and classification of assets by growth profile and type. The processed data is then visualized in Tableau dashboards that highlight portfolio allocation, valuation relative to fair ranges, contribution accumulation, and long-term earnings power—providing clear insights for disciplined investment decision-making.

This project demonstrates practical skills in Python, financial data engineering, business analytics, and data visualization, while showcasing a long-term, process-driven approach to investing.
